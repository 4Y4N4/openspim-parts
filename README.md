## Contributing

### What files should I add?

Please add your drawings in at least one common CAD format, such as STL or STEP.

_Additionally_, adding your original drawings (such as in AutoCAD dwg, SolidWorks SLDDRW/SLDPRT/..., ParaSolid x_t, etc. format) is also nice for future reference and to help people build on top of your work.
